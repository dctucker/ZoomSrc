# ZoomSrc
A(n unfinished) source code editor with intense visuals and font resizing

## Notes from my blog-post back in March 2009

- The idea is to produce a source-code editor that can deal with the rigors of C++, multiple files, a header file for each implementation file, and telling the compiler to do its thing. It should do so in a visually appealing manner.
- Progress: It’s usable, but isn’t friendly. It was originally prototyped in Processing.org for the graphical elements, and then ported to wxWidgets.
- This project is something I would use on a daily basis, if I could ever get it done.
- Xcode is actually a pretty decent tool, and I’ve gotten the hang of it, but my editor has a novel 3D interface and is better at dealing with large source files.
